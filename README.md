# Building emails with slim and scss
I created this to make it easy to build email templates. There will still be a bit of copying/pasting to get it to function correctly in our system, though.

Get started with:
```
npm install
```

Then,
```
cd app && gulp serve
```

To get your css-inlined file,
```
gulp build
```
